## ðŸ’¡ Wellness Score Calculation

The Wellness Score is calculated as the percentage of your income remaining after expenses:

**Formula:**  
`(Income - Total Expenses) Ã· Income Ã— 100`

### Score Meaning:
- **81â€“100%** â†’ Excellent
- **60â€“80%** â†’ Good
- **40â€“59%** â†’ Fair
- **0â€“39%** â†’ Poor

A higher score means you're managing your budget well, while a lower score suggests overspending.
