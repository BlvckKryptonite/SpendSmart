## 💡 How the Wellness Score Works

The Wellness Score is calculated as the percentage of your income remaining after expenses:

**Formula:**  
`(Income - Total Expenses) ÷ Income × 100`

### Score Meaning:
- **81–100%** → 🎉 Excellent
- **60–80%** → 👍 Good
- **40–59%** → ⚠️ Fair
- **0–39%** → 🚨 Poor

A higher score means you're managing your budget well, while a lower score suggests overspending.
